# Thirukural Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-09_

This Privacy Policy explains how the Thirukural iOS app (“Thirukural”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and to keeping your usage data on your device whenever possible.

## Information We Collect

Thirukural does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All content is shipped with the app and remains on your device. No user accounts or analytics run inside the app.

## How Information Is Used

Because we do not collect personal data, we do not use or share it for any purpose. Any preferences you set inside the app (such as font size or theme) are stored locally on your device and never leave it.

## Third-Party Services

Thirukural does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising networks, or social media SDKs. The app functions entirely offline except for any links you may choose to open in a browser.

## Children’s Privacy

Thirukural can be used by people of all ages. Because we do not collect any personal data, the app complies with child privacy requirements by design.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this Privacy Policy, we will change the “Last updated” date above and include the new version in the app repository. Material changes will also be communicated through the project’s release notes.

## Contact

For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in the project’s GitHub repository or email the maintainer at `support@example.com`.
